Measures average round aggregation time in Î¼s over 1,000 rounds of aggregation.

- **Native:** AES decryption and summation of each cipher text run without SGX.

- **SGX:** AES decryption and summation of each cipher text run inside SGX.

- **TERSE-Native:** TERSE run entirely without SGX.

- **TERSE-SGX:** TERSE run entirely in SGX.

- **TERSE-Hybrid (ours):** Most summations run outside of SGX. Lookup and final addition run inside SGX.
